# Environmental-Sustainability-Survey-Report
In this project, I analyzed the survey data to create an interactive Dashboard to make Intelligent Business decisions.

### Introduction
Tableau is a powerful tool for data analysis and visualization, it helps to create reports, dashboards, and stories using different charts and graphs. The workbooks and the dashboards created using Tableau can be shared locally or publicly. The Environmental Sustainability Initiative aims to enhance our understanding of the community's environmental concerns and needs by collecting and analyzing data. These insights will be used to identify and address sustainability issues. Machine learning will be employed to understand community sentiments and predict specific parameters.

### About this project

In this project, I used the following steps to create the dashboard:

- Surveyed the St. Clair College students about the Environmental sustainability and following questions were asked:
1.	What is your age?
2.	What is your gender?
3.	What is your level of education?
4.	In which region do you reside?
5.	How concerned are you about environmental issues?
6.	Do you actively engage in practices to reduce, reuse, or recycle products?
7.	On a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being 'Not at all' and 5 being 'Extensively,' please rate the extent to which you currently implement the following practices to reduce your environmental footprint.
8.	Are you interested in making more sustainable choices in your daily life?
9.	Do you think government policies should promote environmental sustainability?
10.	How would you rate the effectiveness of various approaches in promoting the adoption of sustainable behaviors?
11.	Do you have any additional comments or suggestions related to environmental sustainability?
The following are the cleaning steps applied to the dataset:
- Removed columns that were not needed for the analysis
- Changed the names of the columns to make them shorter, for example
- Pivoted all Likert scale question naming as questions and responses to make the visualization easier

### Summary
As we can see from the above analysis, females aged 18 to 24 are more concerned about environmental sustainability, and engaging in such practices is moderate also people in the American region are more concerned about environmental issues. On the other hand, people with bachelor's and master's are more concerned about recycling, reuse, and reducing practices. This survey was taken by around 12 people, and these are thoughts about environmental sustainability.
